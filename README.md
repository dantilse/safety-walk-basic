# Safety walk basic

Creating a basic mockup for the Safety Walk system

## Build notes

This system uses Grunt to compile SCSS file into a minified stylesheet. Still working on getting a proper server environment set up for faster development.

- `$grunt watch`: watches for files to change and recompiles
- `$grunt connect`: opens localhost://3030 and displays the page

**Note:** need to get livereloading working properly
