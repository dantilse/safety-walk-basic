# Safety walk basic

Creating a basic mockup for the Safety Walk system

## Build notes

This system uses Grunt to compile SCSS file into a minified stylesheet.

- `$grunt`: default task watches for files to change and recompiles
- `$grunt server`: does the same thing as the default task above
- `$grunt buildcss`: compiles the CSS stylesheet
